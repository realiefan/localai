# SimpleChat

This folder provides a complete implementation of a simple
chat app based on WebLLM. To try it out, you can do the following steps
under this folder

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Note if you would like to hack WebLLM core package.
You can change web-llm dependencies as `"file:../.."`, and follow the build from source
instruction in the project to build webllm locally. This option is only recommended
if you would like to hack WebLLM core package.

If you are using the Local Server option, first start the local server using the steps outlined [here](https://mlc.ai/mlc-llm/docs/deploy/rest.html).
